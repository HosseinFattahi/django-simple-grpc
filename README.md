‚öôÔ∏è Setup in Django

Add to your `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    "django_simple_grpc",
]

Then add the gRPC configuration:

```python
GRPC_SERVER_PORT = 50051
GRPC_SERVER_ADDRESS = "localhost:50051"

# Replace <your_app> and <YourServiceName> with your actual values
GRPC_SERVICE_REGISTER = "grpc_generated.<your_app>_pb2_grpc.add_<YourServiceName>Servicer_to_server"
GRPC_SERVICE_IMPL = "<your_app>.grpc_service.<YourServiceName>Servicer"


üîÅ Example if your app is called store and your service is ProductService:

```python
GRPC_SERVICE_REGISTER = "grpc_generated.store_pb2_grpc.add_ProductServiceServicer_to_server"
GRPC_SERVICE_IMPL = "store.grpc_service.ProductServiceServicer"
